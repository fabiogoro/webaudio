This is a tutorial about Web Audio API.

Each of the folders contain a lesson, which is a working example.
Try to understand an example and jump to the next one,
each one is a little bit harder then the last one.

At the end of the current 7 examples you should be able of:

- Starting Web Audio Objects
- Using the Oscillator to create sounds with different frequencies
- Controling volume of the sound and its waveform
- Applying all of this to create a piano on the browser
- And in the end: Using peer.js to exchange info of Web Audio through browsers

This repository should be easy to run in any computer,
just clone it and open the index.html file in any browser.

To upload a copy of it online, you will need a Rack server.
At Heroku you should easily be able to upload it.
